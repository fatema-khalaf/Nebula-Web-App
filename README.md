# Nebula-Web-App
An online book store, developed by me using ASP.Net 
(admin and internet user app) each page in the dashboard has the features of (view, add, edit and delete)
which means that the admin is able to perform these actions on any data record in the database.
Each page is created and customized with data components that are compatible with the requirements of it, 
for example (the author page in the dashboard has the fields of Name, Description, and Image that are exactly 
the defined specifications in the initial stage of this project) and the same for all pages.
The user side and the dashboard are connected to each other as any action (add, delete and edit) 
the admin performs on his side appears immediately on the user side, the application performs it in a right way
